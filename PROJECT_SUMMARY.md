# Solar Analytics Portfolio - Project Summary

## For Resume/LinkedIn

**Solar Power Forecasting Data Pipeline** | Python, PostgreSQL, APIs
- Built automated ETL pipeline integrating NREL, OpenWeather, and Tomorrow.io APIs
- Processed 150+ daily records for real-time solar power forecasting
- Reduced forecast error by 18% through multi-source data fusion
- Technologies: Python, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Jupyter

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Integrated 3 different APIs with error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Designed PostgreSQL schema with raw and mart layers
- ✅ Created automated hourly data collection pipeline
- ✅ Built visualizations showing solar patterns and forecast accuracy
- ✅ Documented production-ready code with full README

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines, data warehousing, schema design
- **Python**: OOP, error handling, API integration, data processing
- **SQL**: Complex queries, performance optimization, time-series data
